# ```RIDERS``` : A BLOG PROJECT WITH LARAVEL AND VUE.JS.

### I-``PHP FRAMWORKS BENCHMARKING:``
There too many framworks, it is difficult to have an objective opinion on wich is the best to use.
For example if the question was specific such as :
  -Wich is the most popular PHP Framwork ?, the answer is LARAVEL.
  -Wich is the fastest to learn ?, the answer is CODEIGNITER.
  -Wich is the best for performance ?, the answer is PHALCON.
  -Wich is the most extandable ?, the answer is SYMFONY.   
  
``Different Frameworks can solve different problems, the answer to "Wich is the best PHP Framwork ?" will always be "IT DEPENDS".``

### Taking for example four popular PHP Framworks:

CodeIgniter : 
- The simplest MVC Framework. 
- Very good documentation.
- Stable enough.
- Using CodeIgniter makes it unavoidable to write spaghetti code (for some parts).
- Very good performance.

Laravel : 
- The most popular PHP Framework.
- Clean Code and follows good practices.
- It may be slow on some environements.
- Preferable for big projects.

Phalcon :
- One of the fastest PHP frameworks (Built with C :heart:).
- Can be difficult to use.
- Stable and fast wich make it the better option if performance is the main priority

Symfony :
- The code quality of Symfony makes it, as of today, one of the best architected and cleanest PHP frameworks available.
- Performance can be an issue sometimes, especially with older versions of Symfony.





### II-``DEFINITION OF SOME CORE CONCEPTS:`` 

I will be chosing LARAVEL for its Command Line Interface, Support for the Database system and migrations, and also its packaging system.

Here are some core concepts of laravel:
 > ``Artisan:`` Laravel has its own command line interface called as Artisan. Common uses of Artisan include publishing package assets, managing database migrations, seeding and generating boilerplate code for new controllers, models, and migrations. This feature frees the developer from creating proper code skeletons. One can extend the functionality and capabilities of Artisan by implementing new custom commands.

 > ``Composer`` is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

 > ``ORM (Object-relational mapping)``, also known as O/RM, and O/R mapping is a programming approach for converting data between incompatible type systems, many full stack frameworks provide their own database abstraction approaches or ORMs, ``The Eloquent ORM`` is Laravel's built-in ORM implementation. Laravel has the best Object-relational Mapper as compared to the other frameworks out there. This Object-relational mapping allows you to interact with your database objects and database relationships using expressive syntax.

 > ``Migratiion:`` Migrations are a type of version control for your database. They allow a team to modify the database schema and stay up to date on the current schema state. Migrations are typically paired with the Schema Builder to easily manage your application's schema.
