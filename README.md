I-``PHP FRAMWORKS BENCHMARKING:``
There too many framworks, it is difficult to have an objective opinion on wich is the best to use.
For example if the question was specific such as :
  -Wich is the most popular PHP Framwork ?, the answer is LARAVEL.
  -Wich is the fastest to learn ?, the answer is CODEIGNITER.
  -Wich is the best for performance ?, the answer is PHALCON.
  -Wich is the most extandable ?, the answer is SYMFONY.   
  
  
  ``Different Frameworks can solve different problems, the answer to "Wich is the best PHP Framwork ?" will always be "IT DEPENDS".``
