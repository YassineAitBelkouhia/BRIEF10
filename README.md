# ```RIDERS``` : A BLOG PROJECT WITH LARAVEL AND VUE.JS.

### I-``PHP FRAMWORKS BENCHMARKING:``
There too many framworks, it is difficult to have an objective opinion on wich is the best to use.
For example if the question was specific such as :
  -Wich is the most popular PHP Framwork ?, the answer is LARAVEL.
  -Wich is the fastest to learn ?, the answer is CODEIGNITER.
  -Wich is the best for performance ?, the answer is PHALCON.
  -Wich is the most extandable ?, the answer is SYMFONY.   
  
  


``Different Frameworks can solve different problems, the answer to "Wich is the best PHP Framwork ?" will always be "IT DEPENDS".``

### Taking for example four popular PHP Framworks:

CodeIgniter : 
- The simplest MVC Framework. 
- Very good documentation.
- Stable enough.
- Using CodeIgniter makes it unavoidable to write spaghetti code (for some parts).
- Very good performance.


Laravel : 
-The most popular PHP Framework.
-Clean Code and follows good practices.
-It may be slow on some environements.
-Preferable for big projects.


Phalcon :
-One of the fastest PHP frameworks (Built with C :heart:).
-Can be difficult to use.
-Stable and fast wich make it the better option if performance is the main priority


Symfony :
-The code quality of Symfony makes it, as of today, one of the best architected and cleanest PHP frameworks available.
-Performance can be an issue sometimes, especially with older versions of Symfony.
